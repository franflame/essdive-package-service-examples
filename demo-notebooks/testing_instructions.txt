A tested version of Search & Download has been created, named "Search_&_Download-Python-new-testable-example.ipynb"
Modifications were made to handle our example dataset and improve error messages, but the core features of the notebook remain unchanged. 

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory "demo-notebooks"

You must first install Pytest and nbval, using:

```pip install pytest```

then 

```pip install nbval```

Open "secrets.txt": enter your authentication token and save the file 

- Navigate to the "demo-notebooks" directory 
Enter the command: ```pytest --nbval "Search_&_Download-Python-new-testable-example.ipynb"```

The tests will now run, and then conclude with a detailed record of passed and failed tests
