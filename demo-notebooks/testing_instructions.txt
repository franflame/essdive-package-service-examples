A tested version of Search & Download has been created, named "Search_&_Download-Python-new-testable-example.ipynb"
Modifications were made to handle our example dataset and improve error messages, but the core features of the notebook remain unchanged. 

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory "demo-notebooks"

You must first install Pytest and nbval, using:

```pip install pytest```

then 

```pip install nbval```

Open "secrets.txt": enter your authentication token and save the file 

- Navigate to the "demo-notebooks" directory 
Enter the command: ```pytest --nbval "Search_&_Download-Python-new-testable-example.ipynb"```

The tests will now run, and then conclude with a detailed record of passed and failed tests

Known issues: 

- If the notebook does not receive a correct response after the API call (in Cell 4), most cells in the notebook will also fail (typically 22 failed, 9 passed). 
There are various causes to this problem; known ones include: an invalid token, ESS-DIVE being under maintenance, and if the search terms do not correspond to a valid dataset.

- Cells 20 and onwards will fail if no CSV file is found in the dataset. Note that the default example in the current version of Search & Download does not have a CSV file.

- Cells 23 and onwards uses column names from the specific CSV file that is being opened. It will cause an error if the column names in the cells do not match up with those in the CSV file
In "Search_&_Download-Python-new-testable-example.ipynb," we modified these cells to be applicable to the dataset we chose.
